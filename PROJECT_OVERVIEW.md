# Project Overview: PupiLove Web

## Description
PupiLove Web is a selfie camera application designed to add a cute and creative touch to your selfies. The camera view is positioned at the top right corner of the screen with rounded edges and a thin white border. At the center of the screen, users can display various shapes (Heart, Star, Cute Bow, and other adorable shapes) in vibrant, neon, changeable colors. A vertical sidebar allows users to select which shape appears in the center. The main capture button is located at the bottom center of the screen, enabling users to take selfies easily.

**Concept:**
The core idea is to let users take selfies where a selected shape is overlaid in the center of the app, aligning with the user's pupil. This creates a unique and adorable effect, making the user's eyes appear to have cute shapes in them.
